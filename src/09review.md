# Review

Diving into user interfaces with C# is a major endeavour, as of writing this section, desktop UI toolkits are heavily fragmented and lacking for cross-platform development.

Make sure you are aware and understand the following.

* What a user interface is
* What a panel, window and control are
* Understanding the differences between responsive user interfaces and the challenges involved.

Make sure you can apply the following.

* Can create a GUI program
* Customise the program with your own events and controls
* Style and align components and use the documentation to make decisions around customising the interface.
* Creating databinding and different event types.
