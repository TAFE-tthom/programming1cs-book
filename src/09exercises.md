# Exercises

User interfaces are always a little fiddly and tricky to work with. Getting familiar with its ins-n-outs are part familiarising not only with this particular framework but also adapting with other frameworks.

## Tasks

### 1. TODO Application

Construct a user interface application that will keep track of tasks that have to be done. Make sure each entry has the following properties.

* Task Name
* Task Description
* Completed

The user interface should contain a list of todo tasks and a form for inputting a new task.


### 2. Photo Gallery

Construct an application that will allow you to view images from a folder. The viewer itself should only show one photo at a time but have controls that allow the user to move forward or backwards through the gallery.

The image that is currently being view should be shrunk or stretched to the proportions of the window.
