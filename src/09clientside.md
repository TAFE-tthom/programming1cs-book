# Client-side Desktop Development

Within this section we will be using a framework to develop a desktop application. The framework/library we will be using is `AvaloniaUI` which is a more modern and versatile framework for .NET.

Part of the choice for AvaloniaUI over MAUI is that it is truly cross-platform rather than what Microsoft advertises with MAUI. It also has a lot of similarities with WPF and existing XAML based UI development.

* Component and Controls
* Utilises standard controls and layouts as well as cross platform development
* Structure and tooling to assist with building simple and complex applications

However, to note, there are some significant drawbacks too. When subscribing to a particular framework, you are also needing to comply and understand what the framework is doing.

* Performance can be significantly impacted by adding another layer
* Understanding how it works requires additional work
* Some features can be unintuitive to implement.

## Topic

We will go through the following topic areas within this chapter.

* XAML and Metaprogramming concepts
* Events, Controls and Structuring
* Basic Databinding and updating

The framing is to establish what is current practice of developing web application and exploring its capabilities and development perspective.
