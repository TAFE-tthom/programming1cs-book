# Classes, Objects and Methods

After wrapping up control flow & arrays we are now going to dive into abstractions for aggregating and composing data. In addition, this chapter will go into methods and modularising code. 

You have likely seen these constructs earlier in some of the examples or by using the standard library functions.

## Topics

These topics are part of composing more complex types and organise out code effectively. Our aggregates constructs such as **Arrays** which we explored prior but now we will look into **Classes** and **Objects** that will give us the ability to assemble more complex objects
and code.

To reiterate, we will go through the following topics.

* Classes
* Objects
* Methods
* Paramters and Return Values
* Indirection and References
* Algorithms

Each topic addresses a limitation you may have already ran into while programming.
